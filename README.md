# `npx taffarel`

The following code is a Javascript program that displays information about the developer, MaurÃ­cio Taffarel, and provides options to learn more about him.

## ðŸš€ Usage
The script can be run in a terminal by executing the file with a Node.js interpreter, such as:

```bash
npx taffarel
```

This will trigger the script to load and start outputting information to the console, including the developer's profile picture, bio and options.

When the user chooses one of the options by pressing enter after selecting, the script will open the corresponding URL in your default web browser.

## ðŸ’» Developing

Make sure to install all the required libraries first before running the script.
```bash
npm install
```

To automatically restart the Node.js server whenever any modification in project files is detected, while developing and monitoring changes, execute:
```
npm run dev
```
